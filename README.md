 üìò Learn in this order:
 
1.	Azure Virtual Network (VNet) ‚Äì the core building block.
2.	Azure Private Link / Private Endpoint ‚Äì secure service access without public IP.
3.	Azure DNS ‚Äì how name resolution works in Azure.
üí° Outcome: You‚Äôll understand address spaces, subnets, peering, and private connectivity.

Step 2 ‚Äì Load Balancing & Application Delivery
‚û°Ô∏è Goal: Learn how Azure distributes traffic and manages high availability.

 üìò Topics:
‚Ä¢	Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4)
‚Ä¢	Azure Application Gateway (Layer 7)
‚Ä¢	Azure Front Door (global CDN + WAF)
üí° Outcome: You‚Äôll know when to use each and how they fit into resilient, global designs.

Step 3 ‚Äì Hybrid Connectivity
‚û°Ô∏è Goal: Learn how to connect on-premises or other clouds to Azure.

 üìò Topics:
‚Ä¢	Azure VPN Gateway
‚Ä¢	Azure ExpressRoute
‚Ä¢	Azure Virtual WAN
üí° Outcome: Understand site-to-site, point-to-site, and private dedicated connections ‚Äî great for global architecture roles.
